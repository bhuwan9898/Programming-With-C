# C Programming Journey üöÄ

Welcome to my C Programming Journey repository! This is where I'll be documenting my progress as I explore the world of C, a foundational programming language widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and more.

## üåü Introduction

C is a powerful, high-performance programming language that has been the backbone of software development for decades. Known for its efficiency and control over system resources, C is often used in operating systems, game development, and hardware programming. Mastering C provides a solid foundation for learning other languages and understanding how computers work at a low level.

## üìö Course Overview

I'll be following a structured approach to learning C, covering the following topics:

### Getting Started with C
- Setting up the development environment
- Writing your first C program
- Understanding C syntax and structure

### Data Types and Variables
- Primitive data types (int, char, float, etc.)
- Variable declarations and initializations
- Constants and literals

### Control Flow
- Conditional statements (if, else, switch)
- Looping structures (for, while, do-while)

### Functions
- Defining and calling functions
- Passing arguments to functions
- Returning values from functions
- Recursion

### Pointers and Memory Management
- Introduction to pointers
- Pointer arithmetic
- Dynamic memory allocation (malloc, free)
- Understanding and avoiding memory leaks

### Arrays and Strings
- Working with arrays
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- Strings and string manipulation functions

### Structures and Unions
- Defining and using structures
- Nested structures
- Unions and their use cases

### File Handling
- Reading from and writing to files
- File pointers and file operations
- Working with binary files

### Advanced Topics
- Bitwise operators
- Preprocessor directives and macros
- Debugging and error handling
- Working with command-line arguments

## üéØ Goals
- Gain a deep understanding of C programming fundamentals.
- Develop efficient and optimized code.
- Build a series of projects to apply what I've learned.
- Create a portfolio of C-based applications and utilities.

## üå± Progress Tracking

I'll be updating this repository with:

- **Code snippets**: Small exercises and examples as I learn.
- **Mini-projects**: To solidify my understanding of key concepts.
- **Notes and resources**: Useful references and tips.
- **Challenges**: Problems and solutions as I work through various tasks.

## üöÄ Future Plans

After completing the foundational course, I plan to:

- Explore system-level programming and operating system development.
- Contribute to open-source C projects.
- Learn C++ to build on the knowledge gained from C.

## üõ† Tools & Technologies
- **GCC**: The GNU Compiler Collection for compiling C programs.
- **VSCode**: My preferred code editor.
- **GDB**: The GNU Debugger for debugging C programs.
- **Makefile**: For automating the build process.

## ü§ù Contributions

This repository is primarily for my learning, but if you have suggestions, resources, or tips, feel free to contribute! I'm always open to feedback and collaboration.
